#Luna

An iPhone app for showing current phase of the Moon, using the [Aeris Weather API](http://www.aerisweather.com/develop/). The app is written in Swift with an MVVM architecture.

You must [register for an API key](http://www.aerisweather.com/signup/) before data can retrieved. Replace the `clientId` and `clientSecret` defined inside [`AerisAPI.swift`](https://github.com/cocoascientist/Luna/blob/master/Luna/AerisAPI.swift#L18-L24) your own.

Read a full write up about the development of Luna at [cocoascientist.com](http://www.cocoascientist.com/luna-displaying-the-moon-phase.html).

If you are working with Swift 2, check out the work-in-progress [`swift-2`](https://github.com/cocoascientist/Luna/tree/swift-2) branch.

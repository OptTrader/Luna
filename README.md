#Luna

An iPhone app for showing current phase of the Moon, using the [Aeris Weather API](http://www.aerisweather.com/develop/). The app is written in Swift with an MVVM architecture.

You must [register for an API key](http://www.aerisweather.com/signup/) before data can retrieved. Replace the `clientId` and `clientSecret` defined inside [`AerisAPI.swift`](https://github.com/cocoascientist/Luna/blob/master/Luna/AerisAPI.swift#L51-L59) your own.
